# Opentale
A full-featured adventure blockgame, inspired by Hytale

# Summary:
This project is an open-source spiritual successor of the cancelled game Hytale by Hypixel Studios. It is a volunteer-powered project planned to be collaborated on through Github, Google Drive, etc. It does NOT have a planned release date, but development builds will be available as they are published to this repository.

# Key Differences:
This project is open-source under the Apache 2.0 license. This means that modding would not be limited to in game knick-knacks, but rather an entire spinoff game could be created without limitations, this follows the original Hytale vision of giving players unprecedented creative freedom.
